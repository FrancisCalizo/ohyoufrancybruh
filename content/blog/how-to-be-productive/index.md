**Stay tuned, this blog post <u>isn't</u> finished!**

Back in 2018, I vividly remember talking to a classmate of mine while waiting for our web development lecture to start. After a few minutes of conversing, he ended our exchange by calling me a "machine...a well-oiled machine". His description of a "machine" was referring to my productivity (hopefully not that I had a personality of a robot), and I was flattered by that compliment.

It was about one year later that I made sure to try to track and maintain that same level of efficiency that I had while in school. I began recollecting what it was that made me so effective in my day-to-day tasks, and what kept me so motivated me to be so responsible in getting sh*t done. Here's how I was able to accomplish that.

## How I Became More Productive

### 1. Use a TO-DO app for tasks and "brain dumps"

Ah yes, the *To-do List*, the other set of words that developers loathe that isn't `hello world`. I guarantee if you search any other articles relating to *'How to be productive'*, *'How to stop procrastinating'*, etc, this will ultimately be on their list of things...to do (**** *ba dum tssssss* ****).

And there's a reason for that: **it holds you accountable**. I made my to-do list one of the few things I made sure to check daily (along with my bank account and statements!). My prefered app to use is <a href="https://todoist.com/app/" target="_blank">Todoist</a>. It's extremely simple and effective; none of that extra filler stuff that could distract you, it's just everything that you expect out of a to-do app.

In just the first week, I was able to feel **much** more accomplished just by checking marking things complete on my list. And that created a **snowball effect**. Once I finished one task, it made me want to knocking things off the list. And it didn't matter if it was something big like finally writing this blog post (*shrugs*), or making sure to call my mom back.

The second thing that made this to-do app so powerful was that it acted as place for a "brain dump". Think about it. How many times have you thought about something that you had to do in your head, only to completely forget about it five minutes later and realizing a week later that you forgot to do it? You probably lost count. It doesn't even have to refer to a task you have to do. Sometimes a great idea pops into your head (*maybe* that next million dollar idea!), but you just don't have the time to dwell on it because you're out to dinner with some friends. All you have to do is put it into your to-do app (I like to just dump it into the *inbox* section of Todoist and categorize it later on) and now you can worry about it later. Don't tell me that's too much work, because it's literally the same amount of effort and time as texting somebody.

With the amount of things we get distracted by these days (aka Technology), this first step is vital. Create a to-do list via an app on your phone. Use it as a brain dump area. Check it daily. Get things done. Reap the rewards.
