Back in 2018, I vividly remember talking to a classmate of mine while waiting for our web development lecture to start. After a few minutes of conversing, he ended our exchange by calling me a "machine...a well-oiled machine".

Our discusion had been about my daily schedule already that day: I had woken up at 0445 and had a two hour workout. After that, I drove to campus to start studying and get a head start on our lesson. I also had been studyng on campus until midnight the night before, which he was made aware of. It was 0900 and our lecture was about to start, and my classmate had just woken up only fifteen minutes prior and arrived just in time for class.

*If you're interested, you can see the schedule I'm referring to on this post right [here](/are-coding-bootcamps-worth-it/), around the middle of the page.*

His description of a "machine" he was calling me was referring to my productivity, and I was flattered by that compliment. It was about one year later that I made sure to try to track and maintain that same level of efficiency that I had while in school. Here's how I was able to accomplish that.
